<h1>Working with MySQL</h1>
By default, TrueTrade comes configured to use Apache Derby, a lightweight, Open Source database
that Sun will soon be shipping with Java by default.  It is a 2Mb JAR file so is easy to deploy,
but some users will want the extra speed and power that a bigged database can provide.  A popular
choice is the Open Source database engine MySQL.<p/>

To configure TrueTrade to run with MySQL, open the database preferences window and set
the following properties:
<ul>
<li>User name = guest</li>
<li>Password = guest</li>
<li>Provider = com.mysql.jdbc.Driver</li>
<li>URL = jdbc:mysql://localhost/ats?enable-named-pipe&socketFactory=com.mysql.jdbc.NamedPipeSocketFactory</li>
</ul>
