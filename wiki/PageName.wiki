#Frequently Asked Questions

*Q: Where do I put my custom Strategies?*

A: In a full release, users will create a standard Java JAR which will be placed in the com.ats.resources plugin.  During development, it is more convenient to place them in the com.ats.model plugin so that Eclipse can perform incremental builds.  If you wish to avoid having your custom strategies placed in SVS, add an SVS ignore rule.
